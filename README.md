# Flight Arrival Tracker:

## Introduction:
- This Flight Arrival Tracker was made by using a simple Grahpical User Interface (GUI) application created by importing the module tkinter in Python.

## Prerequisites:
- Python 3.(any python version above 3.7.5)
- Tkinter (which should be included in the Python installation)

## Run the Application:
### Main Window

Upon opening the application, a GUI window will appear, titled "Flight Arrival Tracker".

### Searching for a Flight Information:

1. User (You) will Enter a valid flight number from data.
2. Click the "Enter" button.
3. This will then display the flight information in the text widget.

### Writing Flight Numbers:

1. Enter a flight number.
2. Click the "Write" button.
3. Write the flight number to the "FlightData-W.csv" file.

### Deleting Entry:

- By clicking the "Delete" button, this clears the flight number entry and result text widgets.

## File Descriptions:

- `Flight Arrival Tracker.py`: This is the main code for the Flight Arrival Tracker Software.
- `FlightData-R.csv`: This is where the data file givenfor reading flight information.
- `FlightData-W.csv`: This is the file where the user chooses which flight numbers details, are to be stored/written in the file.

## Acknowledgements:
1. DR. PETER BLANCHFIELD - for providing a sample data of Flights.
2. tKinter Python - Allowing me to create a GUI.

## Planning Document:
## Simple Flow Chart:
Before starting the Project, I reviewed the Air Flight Tracker Requirements.
I then created a quick Flow Diagram Plan outlining what I could potentially build for the code.
Then the aim was to ensure that all the requirements would be met.

## Class Diagram:
I decided that to create a class diagram I would need to allow for flexibility and adaptability to occur, therefore as I proceed to code I can change or add more classes, methods etc to the current existing design.

## Test Schedule:
1. Ensuring the Quality of code is great
2. Identifying whether there are any bus to fix before submitting final application.
3. Whether code is stable and functioning.
4. Finally it can serve as a valuable documentation for current or further future development.
